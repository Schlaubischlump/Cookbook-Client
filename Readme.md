This is a Cookbook client application to manage your recipes stored in your NextCloud (Cookbook v6.0 and up). For the corresponding NextCloud application see: [nextcloud-cookbook](https://github.com/mrzapp/nextcloud-cookbook). This is not a standalone application! Without the NextCloud backend this application is useless.
